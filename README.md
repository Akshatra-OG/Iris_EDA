# Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and data science, containing measurements of iris flowers' sepal and petal lengths and widths, along with their corresponding species labels.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to conduct EDA on a dataset using popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. EDA helps in understanding the dataset's characteristics, distributions, relationships between features, and identifying potential patterns or outliers.

## Features

- Loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
- Creates a Pandas DataFrame for easy data manipulation.
- Displays basic information about the dataset.
- Provides summary statistics of the dataset.
- Checks for missing values (though Iris dataset is usually clean).
- Visualizes the distribution of each feature using histograms.
- Creates a pairplot to visualize relationships between features, color-coded by target class.
- Uses box plots to visualize feature distributions by target class.
- Generates a correlation matrix heatmap to show feature correlations.# Iris_EDA
